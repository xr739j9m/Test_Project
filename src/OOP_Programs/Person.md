Explain why JAVA does not consider multiple inheritance (5 points)

Create a class called Employee as a a derived class of the class Person. An employee record has an employee's name, address, gender(inherited from the class Person), an ID number whose type is  String, an annual salary represented as a single value of type double, and a year the employee started work as a single value of type int.

Your class should have a reasonable number of constructors and setter methods, as well as getter methods. Write another class containing a main method to fully test your class definition.(Completeness: 10points; Correctness:  10 points)
